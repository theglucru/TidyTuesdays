## Loading TidyTuesday Data

```{r}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2022-01-18')

choco <- tuesdata$chocolate
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
